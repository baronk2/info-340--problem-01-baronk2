                Fantomex is sort of a mutant, but not quite exactly a mutant by definition, who exists in the Marvel Universe. He wears a white suit with black accents and a matching mask that covers every part of his face but his eyes and the bridge of his nose. He has three brains and firearms are his primary weapon of choice. He grew up in a virtual, artificial environment that was made to be like France, so he is culturally and linguistically French, although he can speak English with a French accent. He has a spaceship named E.V.A that is an extension of his nervous system and can do a number of tasks itself. Fantomex is variously associated with the <cite><a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Charlie_Cluster-7_(Earth-616)">X-Men</a></cite>, X-Force, and other groups in Marvel's mutant cause.

            <h3>
                Reasons I like Fantomex
            </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    He grew up in an entirely virtual environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    E.V.A. is basically a drone extension of him.
                </li>
                <li class="important">
                    He has three brains!
                </li>
                <li>
                    He has the Spiderman mask aesthetic kind of going for him, like Deadpool and Venom do. He's like if you went from Spiderman to Deadpool, and then went in the same direction another hop of a similar distance.
